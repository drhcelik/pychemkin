    "One of the important properties of hydrocarbon fuel is the <i><u>ignition delay time</u></i>. For automobiles, the gasoline is graded by the <i>octane number</i> which is closely related to the fuel's ignition characteristics. Higher octane number fuel tends to ignite more easily. However, this does not mean you should blindly put the highest octane number fuel into your car. Car engines are designed for specific operating conditions, and you should use the gasoline grades recommended by the car/engine manufacturer to prevent damages to the engine.   "

    "This tutorial employs the <i><u>constant-pressure batch reactor model</u></i> (with the energy equation <u>ON</u>) to predict the <u>auto-ignition delay time</u> of a <em>Primary Reference Fuel (PRF)</em>. PRF is created for automobile fuel researches and consists of two major components: n-heptane $C_{7}H_{16}$ and iso-octane $C_{8}H_{18}$. By definition, n-heptane is assigned with an octane number of 0, and an octane number of 100 for iso-octane. Thus, a PRF of 20% n-heptane and 80% iso-octane has an octance number of 80. In this tutorial, a PRF 60 fuel is used to show the <i>negative temperature coefficient (NTC)</i> behavior in the ignition delay curve. The ignition delay curve is constructed by collecting the predicted auto-ignition delay times with various initial gas conditions. Here, the initial gas temperature is increased from 700K to 1080K.
