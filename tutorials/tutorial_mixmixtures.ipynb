    "<strong>Pychemkin</strong> provides a set of basic mixture utilities enabling the creation of new mixtures from the existing ones. The mixing method, as its name suggested, let you combine two mixtures at constant pressure with specific constraints. The <i><u>adiabaticmixing</u></i> method combines the two mixtures while keeping the overall enthalpy constant. The temperature of the combined mixture, in this case, is determined by the conservation of the overall enthalpy of the two \"parent\" mixtures. The <i><u>isothermalmixing</u></i>, on the other hand, simply combines the two mixtures and determines the composition of the final mixture according to the mole or mass ratios specified. You can assign any temperature value to the combined mixture since the enthalpy conservation is not considered by this method."

    "This tutorial will show you the usage of these two <em>Mixture</em> mixing methods, <i><u>isothermalmxing</u></i> and <i><u>adiabaticmixing</u></i>, and the difference in the temperature of the combined/final mixture between the two mixing methods. You will first create a fuel (CH4) mixture and an air (O2+N2) mixture and then make a fuel-air mixture by mixing them isothermally (i.e., without considering energy conservation) with a given air-to-fuel mass ratio. Afterwards, you will dilute the fuel-air mixture with argon (AR) adiabatically with the molar/volumetric ratio specified.   "
