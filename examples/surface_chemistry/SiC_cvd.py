======================================================
Simulating the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process
======================================================
The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process plays an important part in the
semiconductor industries, especially for manufacturing and processing the wafers.

This example project presents a model for the CVD of silicon nitride (Si-N) in a
steady-state PSR. The utilization of the simple PSR model is justified because
the CVD process is operated under the "kinetic limited" condition and is running
steadily. The CVD PSR is characterized by the volume, the substrate surface area,
and the inlet precursor gas volumetric flow rate; consequently the reactor
residence time remains constant even when the precursor stream composition or
the reactor temperature is changed.

The current CVD process operates at a low pressure of 1.8 Torr, and a high temperature
(for both gas phase and the substrate surface) of 1440 |deg|C. The precursor stream
consists of SiF\ :sub:`4` and NH\ :sub:`3`\ .
The chemistry set contains the gas phase mechanism input file, "chem_SIN_cvd.inp",
the surface mechanism input file "surf_SIN_cvd.inp", and the thermodynamic data file,
"therm.dat". The two mechanism input files are in the "example\data\SIN_CVD" folder,
and the generic thermodynamic data file is in the "data" folder of the Ansys Chemkin
installation. The chemistry set is described in the Si-N CVD from Silicon Tetrafluoride
and Ammonia section of the *Chemkin Tutorial* manual (p. 346).

When a reactor model is instantiated with a ``Mixture`` or a ``Stream`` that is made of
a ``Chemistry Set`` with a surface mechanism, the surface chemistry module of the
reactor model will be automatically initialized with the surface mechanism data from
the ``Chemistry Set``. There is no additional step to "turn on" the surface mechanism
for the reactor model.

You will determine the effects of the inlet SiF\ :sub:`4` and NH\ :sub:`3` molar
ratio on the linear growth rate (deposition rate) of the Si-N layers on
the substrate while keeping the reactor temperature and pressure fixed. The inlet
composition can be easily changed by resetting the inlet stream composition.

In addition to the bulk species (Si and N) growth rates, you can get the reactor
gas composition and the substrate surface coverage from the steady-state PSR solution
for each case. You can also obtain the total surface rate-of-production
(surface ROPs) from the solutions to analyze the important reaction pathways of the CVD
process.

The solution plots show the dependencies of the mole fraction of gas product HF, the
substrate surface coverage, the Si linear growth rate, and the surface consumption
rates of the precursors on the inlet SiF\ :sub:`4` molar ratios. The results shows that
the deposition rate can be controlled by adjusting the precursor molar ratio. The growth
rate could reach its max value When both precursors have the same molar concentration.
Moreover, the negative surface ROPs indicate that surface reactions (rather than gas
reactions) are the dominate decomposition pathways of the gas-phase precursors.

# Create a chemistry set
# ======================
# This example uses the surface mechanism of Si-N chemical vapor deposition (Si-N CVD)
# from Silicon tetrafluoride (SiF\ :sub:`4`\ `). The reaction mechanism consists of two
# parts: the gas-phase mechanism, ``chem_CIN_cvd.inp``, describing the breakdown
# of the precursors in the gas phase; and the surface mechanism, ``surf_SIN_cvd.inp``,
# describing the reactions taking place on the substrate surface, such as the
# adsorption of the gas precursors, the reactions between the adsorbed surface species,
# and desorption of gas products for the overall process of the deposition of the Si
# and the N atoms.
#
# This mechanism is provided in the *examples\data* folder of the local
# *PyChemkin* installation. You must provide the mechanism file names,
# ``chem_SIN_cvd.inp`` and ``surf_SIN_cvd.inp``, with the correct path
# ``example_mech_data`` to the Chemistry Set before pre-processing. The thermodynamic

# Use the ``mass_flowrate`` method to assign the inlet mass flow rate.

# Instantiate the PSR ``cvd_reactor`` as a ``PSRSetVolumeFixedTemperature``
# object. Since the goal is to show how precursor stream
# composition affects the Si-N deposition rate, both the gas and the surface
# temperatures are fixed. The inlet precursor mixture ``precursors``
# composition will be applied as the estimated reactor condition of the

# any estimated reactor conditions by using appropriate methods. For example,
# ``cvd_reactor.temperature = 2000.0`` changes the estimated reactor temperature
# from 1713.15 to 2000 [K]. The residence time is calculated from the inlet steam
# velocity and the PSR volume.

############################################
# Set up additional reactor model parameters

# Before you can run the simulation, you must provide reactor parameters,

# any estimated reactor conditions, such as the reactor temperature, the gas

# in addition to the solver parameters.

##################################
# Connect the inlet to the reactor
# ================================
# You must connect at least one inlet to the open reactor. Use the ``set_inlet()``
# method to add a stream to the PSR. Inversely, use the ``remove_inlet()`` to
# disconnect an inlet from the PSR.
#
# .. note ::
#   There is no limit on the number of inlets that can be connected to a PSR.

# Set up surface chemistry parameters
# ===================================
# When the ``Mixture`` or the ``Stream`` used to initiate the reactor model includes
# *surface chemistry*, the surface chemistry data and properties will automatically
# set up by the reactor model. However, you need to provide some essential surface
# chemistry related model parameters. For example, you need to specify the activate
# surface area as well as the temperature for each material defined in the surface
# mechanism if it is different from the gas temperature. By default,
# all site species have the same fraction and all bulk have activity of unity.
# You can explicitly provide the site fractions and bulk activities when the default
# surface coverage fail to get a converged solution.

# ================================
# You can overwrite the default solver controls by using solver-related methods,
# such as those for tolerances. Here the tolerances that the steady-state solver
# is to use for the *steady-state search* and the *pseudo time stepping* stages
# are changed by using the ``steady_state_tolerances`` method. Sometimes, during
# the iterations, some species mass fractions might become negative, causing the
# solver to report an error and stop. To overcome this issue, you can use the
# ``set_species_floor()`` method to provide a small cushion, allowing species
# mass fractions to go slightly negative (during the iterations) by resetting
# the mass fraction floor value.

# reset the tolerances in the steady-state solver

# Run the inlet precursor composition parameter study
# ===================================================
# In the parameter study, the composition of the inlet SiF\ :sub:`4`\ molar ratio
# is done by resetting the molar composition of the inlet stream
# ``precursors`` with the recipes of the ``inlet_recipes`` list.
#
# Use the ``process_solution()`` method to convert the result from each PSR run
# into a solution ``Stream``. The surface site fractions and the bulk growth rates
# can be extract from the solution stream ``solnmixture`` with the
# ``surface_chemistry`` methods ``get_all_site_frac()`` and
# ``get_all_bulk_growth_rates()``, respectively.
# You can use the ``rop_surf()`` method to get the surface ROP of the gas
# species, the site species, and the bulk species of a surface material.
#
# .. note ::
#   In Pychemkin, the surface material is referred by its name. Instead of
#   the surface material index, you loop over the surface material names.
