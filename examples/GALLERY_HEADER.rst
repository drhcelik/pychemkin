Examples
========

This section shows how to use PyChemkin utilities and reactor models to perform different types of simulations. Early examples demonstrate how to perform essential operations, such as loading and preprocessing the chemistry set. Later examples explain how to tackle more complex simulations, such as running an ignition delay parameter study. Thus, you should go through the examples in the order listed.
