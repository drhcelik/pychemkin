Overview
--------
PyChemkin (Ansys-chemkin package) provides Pythonic access to Ansys Chemkin. It facilitates programmatic customization of Chemkin simulation workflow within the Python ecosystem and permits access to Chemkin property and rate utilities as well as selected reactor models:

- Process Chemkin-compatible gas-phase mechanisms
- Evaluate species and mixture thermodynamic and transport properties
- Compute reaction rate of progress and species rate of production (ROP)
- Combine gas mixtures isothermally or adiabatically
- Find the equilibrium state of a gas mixture
- Run gas-phase batch reactor models
